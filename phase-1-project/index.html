      <h1>Minecraft Biomes Explorer</h1>
      <p>MMinecraft is a blocky sandbox game made up of blocks, although the game was first released in 2009, it still remains a very popular game amongst games of all ages. The beauty of minecraft is that it has no set goals and can be played however the player would love. If you like being creative, you can use blocks to build things from your imagination all across the dimensons, biomes, wherever you’d like to in the game. If you’re into survivial games and likes to explore and face challenges, you can also go down that path. Blocks can be broken, crafted, placed to reshape the landscape, or used to build fantastical creations. </p>

      <h1>Minecraft dimensions</h1>
      <br>
      <p>In vanilla Minecraft, there are a total of 3 different dimensions. Players can travel and explore various dimensions through the use of portals, which are obsidian stones built in the shape of a doorway and then lit up with a flint and stone.</p>
        <br>
        <p>
        The normal dimension, where players typically spends majoirty of their game time is known as the Overworld. The overworld is filled with many different biomes, mobs, villages and villagers., weather changes, daylight cycles. The overworld is where you set your respawn point by clicking on a bed.</p>
        <br>
        <p>
        The Nether is considered the underworld of the game, this dimension contains oceans of lava. This dimension is naturally generated in a chaotic, messy, and cave-like manner, with a ceiling of bedrock and filled with netherrack blocks. It is home to bastion remnants, and nether fortresses where players can raid to find treasures. </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        The end is a space-like dimension with floating end stone islands that are all randomly generated. Unlike the nether where you can travel through any obsidian door you built anywhere in the overworld, the end requires a specisial doorway known as the end portal inside of a stronghold. This is usually known as the end game dimension where you can find end game items such as Elytra (wings) and shulker boxes (more storage). </p>
